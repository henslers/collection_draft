## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

Currently, this template exists to fuel my desire to learn code while also triggering my desire to cause chaos (the goal is to keep me invested by letting me pretend that this is destructive) (this is how I'm expressing feminine rage). 

For full details of creating your own collection site, visit [CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/)!

## **What's Next for Pit of Misery?**
- changing all image file to classic memes
- setting all the map locations to make a silly shape
- testing potential transcription options for my real class assignment repository (working with handwritten letters from War of 1812)
